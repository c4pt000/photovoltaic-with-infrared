# photovoltaic-with-infrared


recharging devices using invisible infrared light to excite electrons on a type of photovoltaic plate receptive to the infrared spectrum

* think solar powered charging even in the dark (since infrared is invisible to the human field of vision

to be utilized for low power consumer devices for recharging devices indoors even in dark environments with an infrared emitter

instead of qi wireless charging on a table top pad

an infrared emitter in a room can allow for wireless recharging
even if someone turns out a light to recharge a device overnight
